# Data-storage-and-retrieval-system
Data to be stored is applied as the input and load signal is asserted. The FSM increments the memory write address for every new data input and load signal applied. When the memory becomes full, the output signal done goes high. The stored data can be read at any address location by specifying the address and asserting read signal.
